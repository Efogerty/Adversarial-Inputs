# Adversarial-Inputs
This was a project that required me to understand the weaknesses of data structures like the hash table, and algorithms like quicksort. 
Using this knowledge, I was tasked with making the input data structure/function work inefficiently.

Bad1.cpp is a code made to break the longest line of sight algorithm. 
The Line of sight algorithm lets a number have "vision" over all numbers to its left and right that are smaller than it. Equal and larger numbers stop their vision.

Bad2.cpp is a code made to break the hash table.
Hash tables break if they send all inputs to the same position, effectively making the hash into a 1d array.

Bad3.cpp is a code made to break the quicksort algorithm (WIP).
